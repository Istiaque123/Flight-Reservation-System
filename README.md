🌟 About the Project
The Flight Reservation System is a Java-based application designed to streamline flight bookings, cancellations, and management. It supports users in searching for direct and connecting flights, booking seats, and managing their reservations, while admins can add, modify, or remove flights and generate reports. Built with efficient data structures like AVL Trees for seat management and a CityTrie for city search, it’s perfect for learning about algorithms and system design or contributing to open-source aviation software.
